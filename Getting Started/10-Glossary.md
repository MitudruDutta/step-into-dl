## Core Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Activation Function** | Non-linear function applied to neuron outputs (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh) |
| **Backpropagation** | Algorithm for computing gradients by propagating errors backward |
| **Batch** | Subset of training data processed together before weight update |
| **Bias** | Learnable parameter added to weighted sum, allows shifting activation |
| **Epoch** | One complete pass through the entire training dataset |
| **Gradient** | Derivative of the loss with respect to model parameters |
| **Inference** | Using a trained model to make predictions on new data |
| **Loss Function** | Measures how far predictions are from actual values |
| **Optimizer** | Algorithm that updates weights based on gradients |
| **Tensor** | Multi-dimensional array; the fundamental data structure in deep learning |
| **Weight** | Learnable parameter determining connection strength between neurons |
